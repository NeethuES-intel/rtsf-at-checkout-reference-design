# Phase 2 - Bring Your Own Software

## Overview

Phase 1 taught you about events that are generated by components in the reference solution. In Phase 2, you start integrating your own software. As you replace components with software, event simulation will no longer be required. 

Your POS of choice must send **POS events** to either the Edgex REST or MQTT Device service. See [POS Events](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#pos-events) for details about each **POS event**, and see [Device Services](../device_services.md) for instructions to send events. 

If you don't have a POS of choice yet, try an open source POS to get familiar with the POS integration. 

Continue reading for general instructions to integrate your POS of choice.

## Integrating your POS of choice

To build a POS system that integrates with our reference design you can use the following event types to trigger your custom code to send POS transactions to EdgeX.

| Event             | Explanation                                                                                      | REST device service events |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Add Line Item     | A new line item is added to the ticket                                                      | [basket-open](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#basket-open), [scanned-item](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#scanned-item)  |
| Remove Line Item  | A line item is removed from the ticket                                                      | [remove-item](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#remove-item)                |
| Total Calculation | The customer is ready to begin payment                                                      | [payment-start](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#payment-start)              |
| Payment Result    | A successful payment has been received                                               | [payment-success](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#payment-success), [basket-close](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#basket-close)            |



## Results

Instead of using the event simulator to send [POS Events](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#pos-events) you can use your POS of choice.
