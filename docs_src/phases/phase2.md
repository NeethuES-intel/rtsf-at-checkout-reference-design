# Phase 2 - Bring Your Own Software

## Overview

After completing Phase 1, you should now have an understanding of the various events that are generated by the various components in the reference solution. This guide will help you to start integrating your own software. As more components are replaced with actual software, event simulation will no longer be required. 

Your POS of choice must send **POS Events** to either the Edgex REST or MQTT Device service. See the [POS Events](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#pos-events) section for details about each **POS event** and the [Device Services](../device_services.md) section for details on how to send the events. 

If you don't currently have a POS of choice, we recommend using an open source POS to get familiar with the POS integration. The following guide has general integration instructions for integrating your POS of choice.



### Upload Products List

For any POS you choose, you'll want to ensure that it is loaded with the products below. It is provided in CSV format:

## Integrating your POS of choice

To build a POS system that integrates with our reference design you can use the following event types to trigger your custom code to send POS transactions to EdgeX.

| Event             | Explanation                                                                                      | REST device service events |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Add Line Item     | When a new line item is added to the ticket                                                      | [basket-open](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#basket-open), [scanned-item](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#scanned-item)  |
| Remove Line Item  | When a line item is removed from the ticket                                                      | [remove-item](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#remove-item)                |
| Total Calculation | When the customer is ready to begin payment                                                      | [payment-start](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#payment-start)              |
| Payment Result    | After payment has been received, and is successful                                               | [payment-success](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#payment-success), [basket-close](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#basket-close)            |



## End Results

By the end of this guide. You should no longer require the event simulator to send [POS Events](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#pos-events). You should now be able to leverage your POS of choice to replace the [POS Events](../rtsf_at_checkout_events/checkout_events.md#pos-events)  being sent by the simulator in Phase 1.
